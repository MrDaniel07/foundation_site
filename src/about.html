                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The Hope Foundation was founded in 2015 by Sarah Mitchell, a humanitarian leader with a vision of community-driven development. After years of working with international relief organizations, Sarah Mitchell recognized that lasting change requires more than temporary aid—it requires partnership, dignity, and local leadership.</p>
                    <p>What began as a small education initiative in rural communities has grown into a comprehensive foundation serving thousands of families across multiple countries. Under the leadership of Sarah Mitchell, the Hope Foundation has maintained its core commitment: to empower communities to build their own sustainable futures.</p>
                    <p>Today, the Hope Foundation operates programs in education, healthcare, clean water, and economic development, always with community voices at the center of decision-making.</p>

                    <h3>Community-Led Development</h3>
                    <p>We don't impose solutions. Instead, we facilitate processes where communities identify their own priorities, design programs that fit their context, and take ownership of implementation and maintenance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Local Partnerships</h3>
                    <p>We work closely with local organizations, community leaders, and government agencies to ensure our programs align with broader development goals and leverage existing strengths.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Measurable Impact</h3>
                    <p>Every program includes clear objectives, regular monitoring, and transparent reporting. We track both quantitative outcomes and qualitative community feedback.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Long-Term Commitment</h3>
                    <p>Sustainable change takes time. We commit to communities for multiple years, ensuring programs can mature, adapt, and eventually operate independently.</p>
